# Previews recent mail as a tidedeck panel document, read straight from
# TideMail's SQLite cache. The database is opened read-only, so this runs
# safely while TideMail itself is open: the file is in WAL mode, which admits
# one writer and any number of readers.
#
# Reading the cache rather than talking to TideMail is what lets the panel show
# real mail when TideMail is closed, which is most of the time - it is a
# foreground TUI, not a daemon.
#
# Every setting has a working default, so the common case - one account, one
# inbox - needs no configuration at all. When there is nothing to show the
# panel explains itself and names the accounts it can see, because a blank
# panel and a misconfigured one look identical otherwise.
